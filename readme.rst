Breakfast
==========

The most important meal of the day

========
Purpose
========

A complete and balanced meal to start the day. That is why it makes a perfect example of developing using the best practices for Python development.
I will be using this repo as a playground to building a small module called breakfast that will be released to PyPi so others can make use of breakfast.
Primarily targetted as a learning experience for myself others encouraged to helpout if they too like the idea of building a small healthy breakfast to 
start the day and to learn the basics of Python development with the best practices in mind.
